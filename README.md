# SurfelLIO-mapping-and-Localisation
starting point is where vehicle data in rosbag shows all types of visualisations L0L1 and surfels in pangolin(stagnant pcd to surfel full map incl.). further versions continue
with the 26-02-26 version i have included the pcd to surfel map creation and visualisation
thi is of no use ig.... because we have created a localisation-only mode which has loading th epcd and converting to surfel and reloading to use it as a ref map.
